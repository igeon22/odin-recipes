	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Needless to say rice and beans are a staple in the carribean. A meal is not a meal unless there is a side of rice and beans. Haitian rice and beans can be made with a variety of beans, but the most pouplar are Pinto, red kidney beans, and black beans. The process is pretty much the same regardless of which beans you use. The dish is very nutritious. Rice is rich in starch and an excellent source of energy. Rice also has iron, vitamin B and protein. Beans also contain a good amount of iron and an even greater amount of protein than rice. Together, they make up a complete protein.</p>
